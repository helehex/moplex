- better branch selection for lambert w
- hybrid hyperbolic trig functions
- fill out multiplex types
- finish removing old work from infrared
    - fill out some of the missing simd operations
- think about renaming `hybrid.s` to `hybrid.real`, and `hybrid.a` to `hybrid.anti`
- think about renaming `hybrid.get_hybrid()` to `hybrid.get_lane()`
- think about either:
    - use individual real and antiox types to distiguish things like `sqrt(Real(-1)) = i` vs. `sqrt(-1) = nan`,
    - keep going with distinguishing function names like hsqrt(-1), hexp(), etc..
