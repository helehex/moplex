- at some point, stop using the `__None=None` anti-pattern. more language features would make it easy.
- fix converting literals to string (when possible)
- add `HybridInt ** Int` overloads
- add literal math functions
- fill out multiplex
- more usage examples, mandelbrot
- better branch selection for lambert w and others
- fill out remaining hybrid trig functions
- rectify imaginary measure with hyperplex better, for pow and such
- HybridVector
- think about either:
    - use individual real and antiox types to distiguish things like `sqrt(Real(-1)) = i` vs. `sqrt(-1) = nan`,
    - keep going with distinguishing function names like hsqrt(-1), hexp(), etc..
