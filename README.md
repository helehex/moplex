# MoplexðŸ”¥
Complex types for MojoðŸ”¥

Mojo version 24.1

Moplex provides generalized complex numbers for the mojo programming language.

Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part which can be added, multiplied, and exponentiated.

`5 + 4i`

The imaginary part multiplied by itself is -1

`i*i = -1`

# Generalized Complex

Moplex also has **Paraplex** numbers (also called dual numbers), and **Hyperplex** numbers (also called hyperbolic numbers)

In Moplex, all three of these type are considered the `unital hybrids`, and the imaginary part is considered the `antiox`

They are similar to complex, in that the antiox also squares to a real number:

Paraplex numbers, written like `3+1o`, has an antiox that squares to zero -> `o*o = 0`

Hyperplex numbers, written like `1+2x`, have an antiox that squares to one -> `x*x = 1`



You can in fact make a number which has an antiox that squares to any real by parameterizing the `Hybrid` type.

This looks like: `HybridInt[-2](0,1)`, which squares to `-2`

# Multiplex

When adding two HybridSIMD types with differing antiox squares, it will result in a **Multiplex** type

Example: `(1 + 1i) + (2 + 2o) = (3 + 1i + 2o)` 

# Using in Mojo

to import and use a type, you can do:

```py
from moplex import moprint, Complex64, Paraplex64, Hyperplex64, HybridInt, i, o, x

moprint(Complex64(-1,-2)**i)
moprint(Paraplex64(1,1) + o)
moprint(Hyperplex64(8,6) * x)
moprint(Complex64(-1,-2) + Paraplex64(1,1) + Hyperplex64(8,6))
```

You can also import just the antiox parts, but they dont sum together yet due to them being HybridIntLiteral type.

(only MultiplexSIMD for now)

This may change with future updates.
